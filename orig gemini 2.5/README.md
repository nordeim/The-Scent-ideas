Okay, let's break this down. I'll first analyze the provided HTML and company description, then explore various improvement strategies, and finally propose a new, improved HTML structure designed for a "Wow Effect."

<think>
**Phase 1: Analysis**

1.  **Analyze Company Description:**
    *   **Company Name:** The Scent
    *   **Core Mission:** Promote mental & physical health.
    *   **Products:** Essential oils (various smells), custom natural premium soap, range of aromatherapy products.
    *   **Key Selling Points (USPs):**
        *   High-quality imported raw materials (global sourcing).
        *   Unique and creative product formulations.
        *   Knowledge of applications (harmonious, balanced, well-rounded products).
        *   Global export (international recognition/demand).
        *   Addresses stress relief (timely and relevant).
        *   Natural, premium focus.
    *   **Target Audience Implied:** People interested in wellness, natural products, stress relief, self-care, potentially premium/luxury market segment due to "premium soap" and "high quality raw materials." Also B2B (corporate scenting, government institutions mentioned later in existing page text).
    *   **Keywords:** Aromatherapy, essential oils, natural soap, mental health, physical health, stress relief, wellness, premium, high-quality, natural ingredients, custom soap, global, unique formulation.
    *   **Brand Vibe:** Should feel calming, natural, trustworthy, knowledgeable, perhaps a bit luxurious or artisanal.

2.  **Analyze Existing HTML:**
    *   **Platform:** Clearly a WordPress site (`wp-content`, `wp-includes`, WP generator tag, WooCommerce generator tag).
    *   **Theme:** Avada theme (v3.9.3 - this is quite old, current Avada is v7+). Older themes often mean more shortcode reliance, potentially less efficient code, and might not use modern WP features like the block editor effectively.
    *   **Plugins:** LayerSlider, Revolution Slider (RevSlider), Contact Form 7, WooCommerce, Projects by WooThemes, Features by WooThemes, Open Social. This is a *lot* of plugins, especially multiple slider plugins, which can impact performance.
    *   **Structure & Content:**
        *   Uses sliders heavily (LayerSlider detected, RevSlider scripts also present). Sliders can sometimes detract from a focused message and impact performance if not optimized well. The slider content seems a bit disjointed (Egg Diffuser, Soap Making Class, Handmade Soap).
        *   Includes WooCommerce (`product` post type, `add-to-cart` buttons, WooCommerce CSS/JS). Product display is a standard grid.
        *   Has a section with "The Scent Story" text, split into columns.
        *   Includes a parallax background image section with testimonials (using a testimonial slider).
        *   Contact info in the secondary header.
        *   Main navigation includes product categories and DIY class.
        *   Footer includes social links and copyright.
    *   **Code Quality & Issues:**
        *   **Bloat:** Extremely large amount of CSS `<link>` tags and `<script>` tags in the `<head>`. This is typical of older feature-rich themes/page builders and significantly impacts loading speed.
        *   **Inline Styles:** Massive `<style id='avada-stylesheet-inline-css'>` block. This contains *thousands* of lines of CSS, likely generated by theme options. This makes overriding styles difficult, hurts performance (render-blocking), and makes the HTML huge.
        *   **Outdated Practices:** Uses `html5shiv.js` for old IE versions (less relevant now). Uses older jQuery versions (`1.11.3`). Includes many IE-specific stylesheets (`ie8.css`, `ie.css`).
        *   **Redundancy:** Loading assets for multiple sliders (LayerSlider, RevSlider).
        *   **Theme Lock-in:** Heavily reliant on Avada-specific classes (`fusion-`, `Avada_393`, etc.). Migrating away or significantly changing the design would be hard without rebuilding.
        *   **Performance:** Guaranteed to be slow with this many assets and large inline CSS block.
        *   **SEO:** Meta description is truncated and seems auto-generated from page content. Heading structure needs review once rendered (H1 for page title, H2 for products/story is okay, but needs validation). Alt text usage seems present but needs verification (`alt="IMG_9356"` isn't very descriptive).
        *   **Design:** Likely looks dated due to the theme version and common design patterns from that era (heavy reliance on boxed layouts, standard sliders, generic icons). It doesn't immediately scream "unique" or "wow."

**Phase 2: Strategy & Options Exploration**

1.  **Goals for Improvement:**
    *   **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean, elegant, visually appealing design reflecting the brand vibe (calm, natural, premium).
    *   **Performance:** Drastically improve loading speed.
    *   **Clarity & Focus:** Clear value proposition upfront, guide users logically.
    *   **"Wow Effect":** Unique visual elements, engaging interactions, high-quality imagery/video, storytelling.
    *   **Maintainability:** Easier to update content and styles.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Flawless on all devices.
    *   **SEO & Accessibility:** Improved structure and content.

2.  **Exploring "Wow Effect" Techniques for "The Scent":**
    *   **Visual Storytelling:**
        *   **Hero Video:** High-quality, slow-motion video background showing essential oil dripping, steam rising from a diffuser, hands crafting soap, serene nature scenes (lavender fields, forests).
        *   **Stunning Photography:** Macro shots of ingredients, beautiful product arrangements, lifestyle shots showing relaxation/benefit.
        *   **Interactive Elements:** Maybe a subtle animation on hover over product categories (e.g., a gentle pulse or color shift), parallax scrolling with layered natural imagery.
        *   **Animated Illustrations:** Custom illustrations that subtly animate to represent scent diffusion or calming effects.
    *   **Sensory Evocation (Visual Cues for Smell/Feeling):**
        *   **Color Palette:** Soft, natural tones (earthy browns, calming greens, muted blues, lavender purples) with selective pops of color related to specific scents (e.g., warm orange for citrus, deep red for rose).
        *   **Texture:** Use background textures (subtle linen, wood grain, watercolour wash) and high-res product photos showing texture (soap grain, oil viscosity).
        *   **Motion & Flow:** Gentle fades, smooth transitions, perhaps particle animations simulating scent molecules (use very sparingly!).
    *   **Unique Layouts:** Avoid standard grids everywhere. Consider asymmetrical layouts, overlapping elements (carefully), full-width sections contrasted with contained content.
    *   **Typography:** Choose elegant, readable fonts. Perhaps a sophisticated serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display, Lora) and a clean sans-serif for body (e.g., Lato, Montserrat, Open Sans - but used more intentionally than the current setup).
    *   **Microinteractions:** Subtle hover effects on buttons and links, smooth scrolling, animated icons that draw attention to USPs.

3.  **Implementation Options (Revisiting with "Wow" Focus):**
    *   **Option A: Revamp Existing WP Site:**
        *   Pros: Keeps existing content/WooCommerce data.
        *   Cons: Extremely difficult to achieve "Wow" with the old Avada base and inline styles. Performance optimization would be a massive battle. High risk of breaking things. *Verdict: Not recommended for achieving a significant "Wow" effect.*
    *   **Option B: New Modern WP Theme + Block Editor/Builder:**
        *   Pros: Can achieve modern look. Better performance base (e.g., Kadence, Blocksy, Astra). Leverages WP/WooCommerce ecosystem. Block editor allows good design flexibility.
        *   Cons: Still WordPress, potential for some bloat depending on plugin choices. Might need custom CSS/JS for truly unique "Wow" elements beyond theme/builder options.
        *   *Verdict: Viable, good balance. Can achieve "Wow" with careful design and potentially some custom code.*
    *   **Option C: Custom Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) + Headless WP/WooCommerce or other backend:**
        *   Pros: Maximum design freedom for "Wow". Optimal performance potential. Clean, specific code.
        *   Cons: Higher development effort/cost. Requires frontend and potentially backend expertise. Connecting to WooCommerce headlessly adds complexity.
        *   *Verdict: Best for ultimate "Wow" and performance, but most complex.*
    *   **Option D: Modern Website Builder (Webflow, Squarespace):**
        *   Pros: High design focus, often good performance, integrated hosting/CMS. Webflow especially offers near-custom-code flexibility.
        *   Cons: Platform lock-in. Migrating WooCommerce data/functionality might be complex or require using their own e-commerce features (potentially losing some specific WP/WooCommerce plugin functionality).
        *   *Verdict: Viable, especially Webflow, if willing to potentially switch e-commerce platform or handle integration challenges.*

4.  **Chosen Strategy for Proposal:**
    *   Design a *new* landing page structure using clean, semantic HTML.
    *   Focus on incorporating elements that *enable* the "Wow Effect" when styled with CSS and JS.
    *   This structure can be implemented using Option B (New WP Theme - ideally with minimal builder/block editor focus) or Option C (Custom Build).
    *   Assume high-quality visuals and specific CSS/JS will be added later to bring it to life.

**Phase 3: Designing the New Structure & Content Flow**

1.  **Header:** Simple, clean. Logo, clear navigation (Shop by Category, Our Story, Wellness Blog, Contact), Cart icon. Sticky on scroll.
2.  **Hero Section:** Full-width video/image background. Centered text overlay.
    *   Headline (H1): Evocative, benefit-driven (e.g., "Rediscover Calm. Naturally.", "Unlock Your Wellbeing with Pure Aromatherapy").
    *   Sub-headline (p): Briefly introduces The Scent and its mission.
    *   CTA Button: "Explore Our Scents" or "Shop Now".
3.  **Introduction/Value Proposition:** Short section below the hero.
    *   Headline (H2): "Escape the Stress of Modern Life" or similar.
    *   Text: Briefly connect aromatherapy/natural products to wellness and stress relief. Introduce The Scent as the guide/provider.
4.  **Featured Products/Categories:** Visually appealing showcase.
    *   Headline (H2): "Crafted for Your Wellbeing".
    *   Layout: Use a clean grid or perhaps an offset/asymmetrical layout.
    *   Items:
        *   Essential Oils: Image, short description, link to category.
        *   Custom Soaps: Image, short description, link to category/info page.
        *   Diffusers/Accessories: If applicable.
    *   Visuals: High-quality product shots or lifestyle images. Subtle hover effect.
5.  **"The Scent Difference" (USPs):** Highlight key differentiators.
    *   Headline (H2): "Why Choose The Scent?" or "Experience the Difference".
    *   Layout: 3 or 4 columns/cards with icons.
    *   Content:
        *   Icon + Title: Premium Ingredients / Text: Sourced globally...
        *   Icon + Title: Unique Formulations / Text: Expertly crafted...
        *   Icon + Title: Holistic Wellness / Text: Promoting mental & physical health...
        *   Icon + Title: Globally Trusted / Text: Exported worldwide...
6.  **Sensory/Benefit Section:** Focus on the *feeling*.
    *   Headline (H2): "Find Your Perfect Harmony".
    *   Layout: Could use parallax background image (nature/spa). Text overlay or cards describing benefits (Relaxation, Rejuvenation, Focus, Balance). Maybe link specific scent types (lavender, citrus) to benefits.
7.  **Our Story/Mission:** Deeper dive.
    *   Headline (H2): "Our Passion for Purity".
    *   Layout: Two columns - Image (founder, workshop, ingredients) + Text (expanded company story/mission from description).
8.  **Testimonials:** Build trust.
    *   Headline (H2): "Hear From Our Community".
    *   Layout: Simple slider or static quote cards. Include name/location if possible.
9.  **Call to Action (Newsletter/Community):**
    *   Headline (H3): "Join Our Wellness Journey".
    *   Text: Invite users to sign up for tips, new product info, offers.
    *   Form: Simple Email input + Submit button.
10. **Footer:** Clean and organized.
    *   Columns: Quick Links (Shop, About, Contact, Blog), Categories, Customer Service (FAQ, Shipping), Contact Info.
    *   Bottom Bar: Copyright, Privacy Policy/Terms links, Social Media Icons.

**Phase 4: Constructing the HTML**

*   Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` for products/USPs).
*   Use ARIA roles where appropriate if adding complex interactive elements later.
*   Use clear, BEM-like CSS class names (e.g., `hero`, `hero__content`, `hero__title`, `product-grid`, `product-grid__item`).
*   Add comments indicating where dynamic content, specific styles, or JS interactions are needed.
*   Ensure basic accessibility (alt tags, heading order).
*   Keep it clean and lean, avoiding inline styles entirely. Link to a single `style.css`.

**(Self-Correction during HTML construction):**
*   Initial thought: Put USPs before products. Correction: Show products first to let users see *what* is offered, then explain *why* it's special (USPs).
*   Make sure the H1 is prominent in the hero. Use H2s for major section titles. Use H3s for sub-sections or card titles.
*   Add `div class="container"` wrappers within full-width sections to control content width where needed.
*   Ensure CTAs are clear and links are descriptive or have aria-labels.
*   Add `loading="lazy"` to images below the fold.

This structured thinking process allows for analyzing the requirements, exploring creative and technical options, making informed decisions, and finally constructing a well-reasoned and improved solution.Okay, I have carefully reviewed the existing HTML and the company description for "The Scent." The current HTML structure is characteristic of an older WordPress site using the Avada theme and multiple plugins (LayerSlider, RevSlider, WooCommerce, etc.). It suffers from significant bloat, primarily due to extensive inline CSS generated by the theme options and numerous script/stylesheet includes. This negatively impacts performance, maintainability, and makes achieving a truly modern, unique "Wow Effect" very difficult without a substantial overhaul or rebuild.

The company's mission focuses on natural wellness, high-quality ingredients, unique formulations, and stress relief through aromatherapy. The desired "Wow Effect" requires a design that is visually stunning, unique, calming, premium, and effectively communicates this mission and value proposition.

**Analysis Summary:**

*   **Current State:** Dated theme, code bloat (especially CSS), performance issues likely, standard layout, difficult to customize significantly.
*   **Company Vibe:** Natural, calming, premium, trustworthy, focused on wellness.
*   **Goal:** Modern, high-performance, visually unique ("Wow Effect") landing page that reflects the brand and drives engagement/sales.

**Recommendation:**

Instead of trying to patch the old, bloated structure, I recommend creating a **new landing page** from the ground up. This allows for:

1.  **Modern Design:** Implementing a clean, elegant aesthetic reflecting the brand.
2.  **Performance Optimization:** Building with clean code, minimal dependencies, and optimized assets.
3.  **"Wow Effect" Integration:** Designing specifically for unique visuals, animations, and interactions.
4.  **Maintainability:** Using semantic HTML and clean CSS for easier updates.
5.  **Flexibility:** This new structure can be implemented either as a custom HTML/CSS/JS project, within a modern WordPress theme using the block editor (or a *lightweight* builder), or on platforms like Webflow.

**Exploring "Wow Effect" Ideas for "The Scent":**

*   **Hero Section:** A captivating background video (slow-motion essential oil drops, steam from a diffuser, serene nature scene) or a stunning high-resolution photograph with a subtle Ken Burns effect. Minimal text overlay with an evocative headline.
*   **Visual Flow:** Use high-quality imagery of natural ingredients, product textures, and lifestyle shots showing calm/relaxation. Employ whitespace effectively.
*   **Microinteractions:** Gentle fade-in animations as users scroll, subtle hover effects on product images/buttons that feel organic, perhaps a parallax effect on background images in certain sections.
*   **Typography:** Elegant serif font for headings (conveying quality/premium feel) paired with a clean, readable sans-serif for body text.
*   **Color Palette:** Calming, natural tones (e.g., soft greens, earthy browns, lavender, muted blues) with potential accent colors derived from ingredients (like citrus orange).
*   **Unique Layouts:** Move beyond simple grids for sections like "Why Choose Us," perhaps using overlapping elements or asymmetrical layouts.

**Proposed New HTML Structure:**

Below is a *semantic HTML structure* for the improved landing page. This is the foundation; the "Wow Effect" will come alive with CSS (styling, layout, animations) and JavaScript (interactions, sliders if needed), plus high-quality visual assets (images/video).

**Explanation and Next Steps:**

1.  **Clean Foundation:** This HTML provides a clean, semantic structure free from the bloat of the original code. It uses meaningful tags and class names (suggestion: use BEM or a similar methodology for CSS).
2.  **Content Placeholders:** I've used the company description to fill in relevant text sections (Story, USPs, Intro). You'll need to replace placeholder image URLs (`images/...`) with your actual high-quality visuals.
3.  **SEO & Accessibility Basics:** Includes improved title/meta description, basic Schema.org structure, `alt` tags (add descriptive text!), `aria-label` where needed, lazy loading for images below the fold.
4.  **Performance Focus:** Minimal initial JS, suggestion for font preconnect, clean structure ready for optimized CSS. Avoids heavy libraries unless necessary (e.g., only load a slider script if you actually use a slider).
5.  **"Wow Effect" Enablers:**
    *   The **Hero Section** is designed for a strong visual impact (video/image background).
    *   Sections like **Products**, **Why Us**, and **Benefits** have clear structures ready for unique visual styling, animations (e.g., fade-ins on scroll), and potentially parallax backgrounds via CSS.
    *   The code structure supports modern layouts (CSS Grid, Flexbox) for creating non-standard, engaging designs.
6.  **Implementation:**
    *   **Create `style.css`:** This is where the visual magic happens. Define your color palette, typography, layouts (using Flexbox/Grid), animations, and responsive rules (media queries).
    *   **Add Visuals:** Source high-quality, relevant images and potentially a background video. Optimize them for the web.
    *   **JavaScript:** Implement necessary JS for any interactive elements like testimonial sliders (e.g., using Swiper.js or Tiny Slider), scroll animations (e.g., Intersection Observer API or libraries like AOS.js), and the mobile menu toggle.
    *   **Integration:** If using WordPress, create a custom theme or use a minimal block-based theme and recreate this structure using blocks, potentially adding custom blocks or using block patterns. Integrate WooCommerce templates as needed for cart/shop functionality if this page links directly to products. If building custom, connect forms and product data to your chosen backend/API.

This new structure provides a solid, modern foundation to build a truly impressive and unique landing page for "The Scent" that aligns with the brand's mission and achieves the desired "Wow Effect." Remember, the HTML is just the skeleton; the CSS, JavaScript, and high-quality content/visuals are what will bring it to life.

---
Here's a thinking process that could lead to the improved landing page design and code:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants an *improved* landing page for their company, "The Scent." Key requirements are:
    *   Reflect the company's mission (mental & physical health through aromatherapy).
    *   Showcase products (essential oils, custom soaps).
    *   Highlight unique selling propositions (high-quality imported raw materials, unique formulations, global reach, stress relief focus).
    *   Achieve a "Wow Effect" (awesome looking, unique).
    *   Review the *existing* HTML (which is quite dated and complex, likely from an older WordPress theme/page builder).

2.  **Analyze the Existing HTML:**
    *   **Structure:** It's a WordPress site using the Avada theme (version 3.9.3, quite old). It uses plugins like LayerSlider, Revolution Slider, Contact Form 7, WooCommerce, etc.
    *   **Content:** The `<head>` is cluttered with many CSS and JS files, typical of older WordPress themes/page builders. Inline styles are extensive (`style id='avada-stylesheet-inline-css'`), making maintenance hard. It includes Open Graph meta tags. The body uses sliders (LayerSlider mentioned) and WooCommerce product listings. The "Scent Story" text is present but buried within layout columns.
    *   **Problems:**
        *   **Performance:** Excessive CSS/JS, large inline style blocks likely slow down the page. Old versions of libraries might have security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Maintainability:** Over-reliance on theme-specific classes and inline styles makes customization difficult and prone to breaking. The code is very verbose and hard to read.
        *   **Design:** While functional, the design relies heavily on sliders and standard WooCommerce layouts, which might not create a modern "Wow Effect." The structure seems fragmented (sliders, then products, then story).
        *   **Responsiveness:** While it claims responsiveness (`viewport` meta tag, media queries in inline CSS), older complex themes can have issues on modern devices.
        *   **SEO/Accessibility:** Hard to tell without rendering, but complex DOM structures and potentially poor semantic HTML could be issues. Title tag is okay ("Scent – The Scent Solution"). Meta description seems auto-generated and truncated.

3.  **Analyze the Company Description ("The Scent"):**
    *   **Core Mission:** Mental & physical health, stress relief.
    *   **Products:** Essential oils, custom natural premium soap. Aromatherapy products.
    *   **Key Differentiators:**
        *   High-quality imported raw materials.
        *   Unique/creative formulations.
        *   Global import/export (implies expertise and quality recognised worldwide).
        *   Knowledge of applications (harmonious, balanced products).
        *   Relevance in modern stressful life.
    *   **Target Audience:** Likely individuals seeking natural wellness solutions, stress relief, high-quality personal care products. Potentially corporate clients (mentioned later in the existing page text, though not in the initial description).
    *   **Keywords:** Aromatherapy, essential oils, natural soap, mental health, physical health, stress relief, wellness, premium, high-quality, natural ingredients.

4.  **Brainstorming Landing Page Improvements & "Wow Effect" Ideas:**
    *   **Modern Design Philosophy:** Clean, minimalist, focus on high-quality imagery/video, elegant typography, intuitive navigation, clear calls to action (CTAs).
    *   **Evoking the "Scent" Experience:** How to visually represent smell and its effects (calm, energy, focus)?
        *   **Visuals:** High-resolution photos/videos of natural ingredients (lavender fields, citrus fruits, herbs), product textures (oil drops, soap lather), serene environments (spa, nature), people looking relaxed/happy.
        *   **Color Palette:** Earthy tones, pastels, calming blues/greens, perhaps accented with vibrant colors representing specific scents (e.g., orange for citrus).
        *   **Microinteractions/Animations:** Subtle fades, parallax scrolling with natural imagery, gentle hover effects that evoke calmness or diffusion. Avoid jarring animations.
        *   **Typography:** Elegant serif for headings, clean sans-serif for body text. Focus on readability and conveying quality/calmness.
    *   **Content Strategy & Structure:**
        *   **Hero Section:** Immediately capture attention and convey the core benefit (e.g., "Find Your Calm with Nature's Essence"). Use a stunning visual (video/image) and a clear headline + sub-headline + primary CTA (e.g., "Explore Our Scents").
        *   **Problem/Solution:** Briefly address the problem (stress, need for natural wellness) and position "The Scent" as the solution.
        *   **Product Showcase:** Feature key product categories (Essential Oils, Custom Soaps) with appealing visuals and brief descriptions. Link to product pages/categories. Maybe a "Featured Products" section.
        *   **"The Scent Difference" / USP Section:** Highlight what makes them unique (Quality Ingredients, Unique Formulations, Global Expertise). Use icons and concise text.
        *   **Benefits Section:** Focus on *outcomes* (Relaxation, Rejuvenation, Balance, Mental Clarity). Connect specific scents/products to benefits if possible.
        *   **Social Proof/Testimonials:** Include customer quotes or logos (if applicable) to build trust.
        *   **The Story/Mission:** Elaborate on the company's philosophy and commitment to wellness.
        *   **Call to Action (Secondary):** Newsletter signup, contact form, link to blog/resources.
        *   **Footer:** Standard links (About, Contact, Shop, Privacy, Social Media).
    *   **Technical Implementation Options:**
        *   **Option 1: Improve Existing WordPress Site:** Update Avada theme & plugins, remove unnecessary plugins, optimize images, clean up CSS (difficult due to inline styles), potentially rebuild the page with a *modern* block editor (Gutenberg) or a *lighter* page builder (e.g., Elementor/Beaver Builder used judiciously). *Challenge: High effort to refactor the existing complex setup.*
        *   **Option 2: New WordPress Theme:** Choose a modern, lightweight, well-coded theme focused on aesthetics and performance (e.g., Astra, Kadence, Blocksy) combined with the block editor or a *minimal* page builder setup. Integrate WooCommerce. *Challenge: Requires migration/rebuilding content.*
        *   **Option 3: Custom Build (HTML/CSS/JS):** Build from scratch for maximum control over design, performance, and uniqueness. Can use frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind or go fully custom. Integrate with a backend/CMS if needed for content/product management (could still be WordPress headless, or another CMS/e-commerce platform like Shopify). *Challenge: Higher initial development cost/effort, requires development expertise.*
        *   **Option 4: Modern Website Builder (Webflow, Squarespace):** Offer high design flexibility and often better performance than older WordPress themes, but less plugin flexibility than WordPress. Might require migrating the e-commerce part. *Challenge: Platform lock-in, potential migration issues.*

5.  **Choosing the Best Option:**
    *   Given the goal of a "Wow Effect" and the highly dated/complex nature of the existing HTML, a full rebuild seems more effective than trying to patch the old site.
    *   A custom build (Option 3) offers the *most* potential for uniqueness and the "Wow Effect," allowing complete design freedom. However, it's the most complex to implement *just* based on the prompt.
    *   A new, modern WordPress theme (Option 2) combined with careful design and potentially some custom CSS/JS offers a good balance of customizability, maintainability (using the block editor), performance, and leveraging the existing WordPress/WooCommerce ecosystem. This is likely the most practical approach for many businesses.
    *   Website builders (Option 4) are viable but might complicate the existing WooCommerce setup.
    *   Improving the existing site (Option 1) is unlikely to achieve a true "Wow Effect" without essentially rebuilding the page anyway.

    *Decision:* Let's propose a structure and design concept suitable for *either* Option 2 (New WP Theme + Block Editor/Light Builder) or Option 3 (Custom Build). The provided HTML code will be a *new* structure, demonstrating the *ideal* final result, independent of the old Avada code. It will focus on semantic HTML, clean structure, and placeholders for dynamic/interactive elements.

6.  **Designing the New Landing Page Structure (Mental Outline):**
    *   `<html>`, `<head>` (Cleaned up: Modern meta tags, essential CSS links, fonts)
    *   `<body>`
        *   `<header>` (Logo, Navigation - simpler than Avada's)
        *   `<main>`
            *   **Hero Section (`<section id="hero">`)**: Background video/image, overlay, heading (H1), subheading (p), CTA button.
            *   **Intro/Problem (`<section id="intro">`)**: Brief text about modern stress, transition to natural solutions.
            *   **Product Categories (`<section id="products">`)**: Heading (H2), grid layout (divs/articles) for Oils & Soaps, images, short descriptions, links.
            *   **Why Choose Us / USP (`<section id="why-us">`)**: Heading (H2), grid/flexbox layout with icons + text (Quality, Formulation, Global Reach, Wellness Focus).
            *   **Benefits (`<section id="benefits">`)**: Heading (H2), perhaps use imagery associated with benefits (relax, rejuvenate, balance), short text. Could use parallax background here.
            *   **The Scent Story (`<section id="story">`)**: Heading (H2), more detailed text from the company description. Maybe an image of the founder or workshop.
            *   **Testimonials (`<section id="testimonials">`)**: Heading (H2), slider/cards with quotes.
            *   **CTA / Newsletter (`<section id="cta">`)**: Heading (H2/H3), brief text, email signup form.
        *   `<footer>` (Copyright, essential links, social media icons - cleaner implementation).
    *   **(Optional Wow Elements):** Subtle animations on scroll (fade-ins), parallax backgrounds, interactive scent finder (more complex), video backgrounds.

7.  **Developing the HTML Code:**
    *   **DOCTYPE & Head:** Start clean. Include viewport, charset, title, basic meta description (improve on original), link to a placeholder CSS file (`style.css`), and potentially Google Fonts.
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, appropriate heading levels (H1-H6).
    *   **Structure Content:** Use divs with meaningful class names (e.g., `hero-content`, `product-grid`, `usp-item`) for styling with CSS.
    *   **Placeholders:** Use comments `<!-- ... -->` to indicate where images, videos, dynamic content (like product loops), or complex JS interactions (sliders, animations) would go. Add placeholder text and images (`placeholder.jpg`).
    *   **Accessibility:** Use `alt` attributes for images, proper heading structure, descriptive link text (or add `aria-label`).
    *   **CTAs:** Use clear `<button>` or `<a>` elements styled as buttons.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Structure the HTML logically so it can be styled effectively for different screen sizes using CSS media queries (the CSS itself isn't requested, but the HTML structure should support it). Use container divs (`div class="container"`).
    *   **Wow Factor Implementation Notes:** Add comments suggesting *how* the wow factor could be added via CSS/JS (e.g., `<!-- Add parallax effect via CSS -->`, `<!-- Implement fade-in animation on scroll -->`).

8.  **Refining the Code and Explanation:**
    *   **Review HTML:** Check for typos, closing tags, semantic correctness, logical flow.
    *   **Add Comments:** Explain the structure and the purpose of different sections.
    *   **Explain the Approach:** Clearly state that this is a *new structure*, not a modification of the old one. Explain *why* this approach is better (performance, maintainability, design flexibility).
    *   **Suggest Next Steps:** Recommend choosing an implementation method (New WP Theme, Custom, etc.), creating CSS for styling and responsiveness, adding high-quality visuals, and integrating with WooCommerce if needed.
    *   **Address "Wow Effect":** Explicitly mention how the proposed design elements (visuals, animations, layout, typography) contribute to the "Wow Effect."

9.  **Final Output Formulation:** Start with the analysis of the old code and company mission. Explain the chosen approach (rebuild for "Wow"). Present the new HTML structure with detailed comments. Provide explanations for the design choices and sections. Suggest concrete ways to achieve the "Wow Effect" through CSS/JS/Visuals. Conclude with implementation recommendations.
