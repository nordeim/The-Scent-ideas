Since your audio shows a bitrate of **48000 bits per second**, you can first estimate how long each 22 MB segment should be. Here’s how to break it down:

1. **Convert 22 MB to Bytes:**  
   One MB is typically 1,048,576 bytes, so:  
   \[
   22 \times 1\,048\,576 \approx 23\,068\,672 \text{ bytes}
   \]

2. **Convert Bitrate to Bytes Per Second:**  
   The reported bitrate is 48,000 bits/s. Converting to bytes per second:  
   \[
   \frac{48\,000}{8} = 6\,000 \text{ bytes/s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Duration per Segment:**  
   Divide the desired segment size by the bytes per second to get the approximate duration in seconds:  
   \[
   \frac{23\,068\,672 \text{ bytes}}{6\,000 \text{ bytes/s}} \approx 3\,844 \text{ seconds}
   \]  
   That’s roughly 3844 seconds (about 1 hour, 4 minutes, and 4 seconds).

4. **Using FFmpeg’s Segment Muxer:**  
   Although your FFmpeg build doesn’t support `-segment_max_filesize`, you can split your file based on time. Run the following command in your Ubuntu terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i relaxing-music.m4a -c copy -f segment -segment_time 3844 -reset_timestamps 1 relaxing-music-%03d.m4a
   ```
   
   **Explanation of Options:**
   - `-i relaxing-music.m4a`: Specifies the input file.  
   - `-c copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding (this ensures speed and preserves the original quality).  
   - `-f segment`: Uses the segment muxer to split the file into parts.  
   - `-segment_time 3844`: Sets each segment’s duration to approximately 3844 seconds.  
   - `-reset_timestamps 1`: Resets timestamps on each segment to enhance playback consistency.  
   - `relaxing-music-%03d.m4a`: Names the output files sequentially (e.g., relaxing-music-000.m4a, relaxing-music-001.m4a, etc.).

5. **A Few Things to Keep in Mind:**  
   - **Accuracy:** Splitting by time means that the file sizes will be approximately 22 MB *if* the bitrate is consistent. If the audio uses variable bitrate (VBR), the sizes might vary.  
   - **Keyframe/Packet Boundaries:** The split points depend on packet boundaries, so the actual segment sizes may be slightly different from 22 MB.
   - **Verification:** After splitting, you can check the size of each segment with:
     ```bash
     ls -lh relaxing-music-*.m4a
     ```

This method lets you approximate the 22 MB limit by controlling the segment duration based on your audio’s bitrate. If you’d like to explore further options—such as re-encoding to a fixed bitrate or scripting a more automated segmentation process—feel free to ask!

The error

```
Unrecognized option 'segment_max_filesize'.
Error splitting the argument list: Option not found
```

means that your current FFmpeg build doesn’t recognize the `-segment_max_filesize` option. Even though this option exists in newer documentation and in some builds, not every packaged version (such as the one from Ubuntu’s repositories) has been built with support for it.

Below are two alternative approaches to achieve a similar result:

---

### **Option 1: Use a Time-Based Split Instead**

If your goal is to keep each segment under roughly 22 MB, you can calculate the approximate duration of audio that corresponds to 22 MB based on the file’s bitrate. For example:

1. **Determine the Bitrate**

   First, find out the bitrate of your audio. You can do this with:
   
   ```bash
   ffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 \
     -show_entries stream=bit_rate \
     -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 relaxing-music.m4a
   ```
   
   Let’s say the output is `128000` (which means 128 kbps). In bytes per second, that’s roughly:
   
   ```
   128000 bits/s ÷ 8 = 16000 bytes/s
   ```

2. **Calculate the Segment Duration**

   With 22 MB defined as 22 × 1,048,576 bytes (i.e. 23,068,672 bytes), the segment duration in seconds would be:
   
   ```
   Duration ≈ 23,068,672 bytes ÷ 16000 bytes/s ≈ 1441 seconds
   ```
   
   (That is roughly 24 minutes.)

3. **Use FFmpeg’s Segment Muxer with `-segment_time`**

   Now, run:
   
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i relaxing-music.m4a -c copy -f segment \
     -segment_time 1441 -reset_timestamps 1 relaxing-music-%03d.m4a
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - `-c copy` copies the stream (no re-encoding).
   - `-f segment` tells FFmpeg to use the segment muxer.
   - `-segment_time 1441` instructs FFmpeg to cut the audio into segments of approximately 1441 seconds each.
   - `-reset_timestamps 1` resets timestamps on each segment to ensure smooth playback.

*Note:* The actual size per segment might vary slightly because splitting happens at keyframe/audio packet boundaries and the bitrate might fluctuate if the file uses variable bitrate encoding.

---

### **Option 2: Manually Script Segmentation Using Byte Limits**

The `-fs` option in FFmpeg limits the file size to a specified maximum. However, it does not create multiple segments—it simply stops writing output once the limit is reached. To mimic segmentation, you could run multiple commands, each starting from the correct timestamp. For example, in a shell script you would:

1. Use `ffprobe` to get the total duration.
2. Calculate, based on the bitrate, how long a 22 MB segment should last.
3. Loop over the audio file, using the `-ss` (start time) and `-t` (duration) options to extract each segment.

Here’s a rough outline in a bash script (assuming a constant bitrate, e.g. 128 kbps):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define constants
SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES=23068672
# For a bitrate of 128 kbps => 128000 bits/s => 16000 bytes/s:
bitrate_bytes=16000
segment_duration=$(echo "$SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES / $bitrate_bytes" | bc)
# Get total duration in seconds
total_duration=$(ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration \
  -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 relaxing-music.m4a)

start=0
i=0

while (( $(echo "$start < $total_duration" | bc -l) )); do
  ffmpeg -ss $start -t $segment_duration -i relaxing-music.m4a \
    -c copy "relaxing-music-$(printf '%03d' $i).m4a"
  start=$(echo "$start + $segment_duration" | bc)
  i=$((i+1))
done
```

**A few notes:**
- This script assumes the bitrate is constant. If it isn’t, the file sizes might vary.
- The `-ss` option in this context does a “cut” without re-encoding; however, accuracy in seeking can vary if not done carefully (placing it before or after `-i` can affect speed vs. accuracy).

### **Why Doesn’t `-segment_max_filesize` Work?**

Your FFmpeg version (from Ubuntu 24.04) appears not to support `-segment_max_filesize`. This could be due to its build configuration. You could try:
  
```bash
ffmpeg -h muxer=segment
```

to see if `segment_max_filesize` is listed. If it’s missing, consider:
- Installing a more up-to-date version or a different build (perhaps from a trusted PPA)
- Compiling FFmpeg from source with the desired options enabled

---

These workarounds let you avoid the unrecognized option error while still effectively splitting your audio file. It’s always a good idea to verify the actual sizes of the output files with:

```bash
ls -lh relaxing-music-*.m4a
```

I looked around and found several relaxing audio tracks that might help you achieve that state of calm. While some of the most popular options are longer—ideal for extended meditation or background ambience—you can always trim them or play just a short excerpt for a quick reset. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **FALL INTO SLEEP INSTANTLY – Relaxing Music to Reduce Anxiety and Help You Sleep**  
   This track by Tranquil Relax is designed to lower anxiety quickly and create an immersive calming experience. Its soothing instrumentation and gentle flow might be ideal if you’re looking for a short clip that you can play during a break or as a quick prelude to your aromatherapy routine. 

2. **3 Hours of Amazing Nature Scenery & Relaxing Music for Stress Relief**  
   Although this video runs for several hours, it features authentic nature sounds and ambient music that capture the essence of natural calm. You could easily choose a 5- or 10-minute segment from it to serve as your brief audio escape. 

3. **Beautiful Relaxing Music for Stress Relief**  
   Offered by the Meditation Relax Music Channel, this video provides a blend of calming soundscapes and visuals that might be just what you need. Again, while the full video is lengthy, you can select a shorter segment that perfectly complements your natural aromatherapy setting. 

Since you mentioned that you’re looking for an audio experience that “enhances well-being and restores balance”—much like blending premium, natural aromatherapy with relaxation—pairing one of these audio tracks with your diffuser (using, for example, lavender or chamomile essential oils) could create a holistic, multisensory experience. If you prefer even shorter pieces, you might want to explore guided meditation apps like Calm or Headspace, which offer brief sessions designed to help you “find your moment of calm.”
