You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now carefully review all the project code files and config files in the current project folder, then think deeply and thoroughly to explore the current project implementation against the given requirement files. also identify any coding and logic errors as well as any missing functionalities and functional inconsistences. then create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words that fully and completely describes the current project implemenation, the document shall include detailed explanations supported by code snippets. start the document by an overview of the design requirements and your design methodology and approach, ending the document with a conclusion and recommendation sections. save the document created in markdown format as file "detailed_technical_design_specification_document.md" in the project root folder.
