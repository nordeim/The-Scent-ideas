*Methodology and Approach*  
Begin with a careful and comprehensive analysis of the current state of the project, and then evolve it into a full-fledged e-commerce platform using the Apache2 + PHP + MySQL stack. We will explore design, functionality, system architecture, and implementation options.

## 🔍 1. **Assessment of Current Landing Page**

The current HTML-based landing page is **aesthetic and thoughtfully designed**. It uses:

- Clean typography (`Cormorant Garamond` and `Montserrat`)
- Harmonious earthy color palette suitable for an aromatherapy brand
- Responsive layout
- Hero section with background image and overlay
- About section layout with grid formatting
- Clear button styles and hover effects
- Animation classes for "fade-in" effects

However, it is **static**.

There is **no backend integration**—no product catalog, shopping cart, user accounts, payment integration, or admin interface.

## 🧠 2. **Company and Product Understanding**

Let’s reiterate the company’s mission and goals:

- “The Scent” focuses on premium aromatherapy products promoting **mental and physical wellness**.
- Products include **essential oils** and **custom premium soaps**.
- Unique selling proposition: **Creative product formulation**, **global sourcing/export**, and a focus on **stress relief**.

This brand evokes **luxury**, **natural ingredients**, and **global reach**.

Thus, the e-commerce platform must:

- Reflect **premium quality** and **trust**
- Be **visually stunning**
- Be **high-performance** and **scalable**
- Support **product customization** (e.g., customers choosing blends)
- Support **international shipping**
- Optionally support **multi-language** and **currency**

## 🏗️ 3. **Design Goals for the E-Commerce Platform**

We should aim for a **“Wow Effect”**. This means:

- A beautiful, immersive product showcase
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Storytelling through visuals
- Interactive product customization experience
- High-quality imagery and video
- Eco-conscious and wellness-centered design

---

## ⚙️ 4. **Technology Stack: Apache2 + PHP + MySQL**

This stack is powerful and proven. To build the platform:

- **Apache2**: Web server
- **PHP (latest 8.x)**: Backend logic
- **MySQL**: Data storage
- **Front-End**: HTML/CSS/JS (with optional JS frameworks if necessary)
- **Admin panel**: PHP-based dashboard

---

- Product Detail Page
- Add to Cart / Wishlist
- Checkout (guest + register)

### B. **Backend Admin Panel**

## 🎨 6. **Design Exploration for “Wow Effect”**

Let’s think of **unique and immersive design ideas** for the homepage:

### Option 1: **Parallax Aromatic Journey**
- Each scroll section is a different aromatic scene (lavender field, citrus grove, forest)
- Parallax effects with floating oil drops, herbs, flowers
- Interactive scent selector experience

### Option 2: **Scent Lab Customizer**
- Let users visually build their own blend
- Drag & drop oils into a virtual mixing bowl
- Real-time scent description (e.g., “Relaxing, Floral, Earthy”)

### Option 3: **360° Soap View**
- High-res 3D-like rotatable soap models
- Zoom and rotate to see ingredients

Best choice: **Option 1 paired with elements of Option 2** (interactive + emotional journey).
